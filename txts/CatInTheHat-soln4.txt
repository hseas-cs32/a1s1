ACTOR: "How I wish
We had something to do!"

ACTOR: "Why do you sit there like that?"

ACTOR: "I know it is wet
And the sun is not sunny.
But we can have
Lots of good fun that is funny!"

ACTOR: "I know some good games we could play."

ACTOR: "I know some new tricks."

ACTOR: "A lot of good tricks.
I will show them to you.
Your mother
Will not mind at all if I do."

ACTOR: "No! No!
Make that cat go away!
Tell that Cat in the Hat
You do NOT want to play.
He should not be here.
He should not be about.
He should not be here
When your mother is out!"

ACTOR: "Now! Now! Have no fear.
Have no fear!"

ACTOR: "My tricks are not bad."

ACTOR: "Why, we can have
Lots of good fun, if you wish,
With a game that I call
UP-UP-UP with a fish!"

ACTOR: "Put me down!"

ACTOR: "This is no fun at all!
Put me down!"

ACTOR: "I do NOT wish to fall!"

ACTOR: "Have no fear!"

ACTOR: "I will not let you fall.
I will hold you up high
As I stand on a ball.
With a book on one hand!
And a cup on my hat!
But that is not ALL I can do!"

ACTOR: "Look at me!
Look at me now!"

ACTOR: "With a cup and a cake
On the top of my hat!
I can hold up TWO books!
I can hold up the fish!
And a little toy ship!
And some milk on a dish!
And look!
I can hop up and down on the ball!
But that is not all!
Oh, no.
That is not all ..."

ACTOR: "Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me now!
It is fun to have fun
But you have to know how.
I can hold up the cup
And the milk and the cake!
I can hold up these books!
And the fish on a rake!
I can hold the toy ship
And a little toy man!
And look! With my tail
I can hold a red fan!
I can fan with the fan
As I hop on the ball!
But that is not all.
Oh, no.
That is not all ...."

ACTOR: "Do I like this?
Oh, no! I do not.
This is not a good game."

ACTOR: "No, I do not like it,
Not one little bit!"

ACTOR: "Now look what you did!"

ACTOR: "Now look at this house!
Look at this! Look at that!
You sank our toy ship,
Sank it deep in the cake.
You shook up our house
And you bent our new rake.
You SHOULD NOT be here
When our mother is not.
You get out of this house!"

ACTOR: "But I like to be here.
Oh, I like it a lot!"

ACTOR: "I will NOT go away.
I do NOT wish to go!
And so."

ACTOR: "So
so
so ...
I will show you
Another good game that I know!"

ACTOR: "Now look at this trick."

ACTOR: "Take a look!"

ACTOR: "I call this game FUN-IN-A-BOX."

ACTOR: "In this box are two things
I will show to your now.
You will like these two things."

ACTOR: "I will pick up the hook.
You will see something new.
Two things. And I call them
Thing One and Thing Two.
These Things will not bite you.
They want to have fun."

ACTOR: "How do you do?
Would you like to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two?"

ACTOR: "No! No!
Those Things should not be
In this house! Make them go!"

ACTOR: "They should not be here
When your mother is not!
Put them out! Put them out!"

ACTOR: "Have no fear, little fish."

ACTOR: "These Things are good Things."

ACTOR: "They are tame. Oh, so tame!
They have come here to play.
They will give you some fun
On this wet, wet, wet day."

ACTOR: "Now, here is a game that they like."

ACTOR: "They like to fly kites."

ACTOR: "No! Not in the house!"

ACTOR: "They should not fly kites
In a house! They should not.
Oh, the things they will bump!
Oh, the things they will hit!
Oh, I do not like it!
Not one little bit!"

ACTOR: "I do NOT like the way that they play!
If Mother could see this,
Oh, what would she say!"

ACTOR: "Look! Look!"

ACTOR: "Your mother is on her way home!
Do you hear?
Oh, what will she do to us?
What will she say?
Oh, she will not like it
To find us this way!"

ACTOR: "So, DO something! Fast!"

ACTOR: "Do you hear!
I saw her. Your mother!
Your mother is near!
So, as fast as you can,
Think of something to do!
You will have to get rid of
Thing One and Thing Two!"

ACTOR: "With my net
I can get them I bet.
I bet, with my net,
I can get those Things yet!"

ACTOR: "Now you do as I say.
You pack up those Things
And you take them away!"

ACTOR: "Oh dear!"

ACTOR: "You did not like our game ...
Oh dear.
What a shame!
What a shame!
What a shame!"

ACTOR: "That is good."

ACTOR: "He has gone away. Yes.
But your mother will come.
She will find this big mess!
And this mess is so big
And so deep and so tall,
We can not pick it up.
There is no way at all!"

ACTOR: "Have no fear of this mess."

ACTOR: "I always pick up all my playthings
And so ...
I will show you another
Good trick that I know!"

ACTOR: "That is that."

ACTOR: "Did you have any fun?
Tell me. What did you do?"

The End.
