ACTOR: "For,"

ACTOR: "no doubt
    If our friend should call in, he will find us all out."

ACTOR: "To rob bears is no sin;
    The three bears have gone out, so I think I'll go in."

ACTOR: "That porridge,"

ACTOR: "may stay long enough there,
    It tastes like the food of the surly old bear,"

ACTOR: "Mrs. B----,
    I think your taste and my taste will never agree."

ACTOR: "This is nice;
    I will put in some salt, and of bread a thick slice."

ACTOR: "This is Tiny-cub's chair, and oh, what will he say?
    His papa is, I know, the most savage of bears,--
    His mamma is a fury; but for her who cares?
    I'm sure I do not; and then, as for her son,
    That young bear, Tiny-cub--from him shall I run?
    No, not I, indeed; but I will not sit here--
    I shall next break the floor through--that's what I most fear;"

ACTOR: "I'm hungry--to eat, let's begin--
    WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE?"

ACTOR: "WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE?"

ACTOR: "WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE AND EATEN IT ALL?"

ACTOR: "WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GREAT ARM CHAIR?"

ACTOR: "WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GOOD ARM CHAIR?"

ACTOR: "WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?"

ACTOR: "There!
    See our pet Tiny-cub can look just like a bear,"

ACTOR: "WHO HAS BEEN UPON MY BED?"

ACTOR: "WHO HAS BEEN UPON MY BED?"

ACTOR: "WHO IS LYING ON MY BED?"

ACTOR: "Let me go, please, I'll soon run down stairs."

ACTOR: "No!
    You had no right to come hither, and now you shan't go.
    What we mean to do with you, ere long you shall find;
    You can lie there and cry till I make up my mind."

ACTOR: "Go and block up the chimney and nail up the door;
    This Goldenhair now has got into a scrape,
    And if I can help it, she shall not escape."

ACTOR: "Three bears, good-bye! Catch me now if you can!"

The End.
