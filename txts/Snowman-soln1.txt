ACTOR: "Ah, you poor sad smiling snowman,
You'll be melting by and by."

ACTOR: "What a pity,
For I'd like to see July.
Yes, I'd like to see July, and please don't ask me why.
But I'd like to, yes I'd like to, oh I'd like to see July."

ACTOR: "Seasons come and seasons go,
And the greatest ice must crumble
When it's flowers' time to grow.
And as one thing is beginning
So another thing must die,
And there's never been a snowman
Who has ever seen July.
No they never see July, no matter how they try.
No, they never ever, never ever, never see July."

ACTOR: "At least I'll try."

The End.
