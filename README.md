This directory contains everything you need as a student for Act I,
Scene I (Scripts).

`seuss.py`: the file we'll begin developing as our starting script in
the first class.  It becomes `seuss1.py`, which is the file we'll use
at the start of the second class.

`seuss1.py` through `seuss6.py`: Code developed in the class gatherings.

`txts`: Directory containing plaintext stories (i.e., `[title].txt`)
and the output you should produce from the different solution scripts
you write (i.e., `[title]-soln*.py`).

`pset1.md`: The description of the programming assignment for Act I
Scene I. Please see the syllabus for when it is due.

`read32.py`: The starter code for the programming assignment.

`tester.py`: A simple testing script that you can run to see where
your solution works correctly and where it fails. It uses
`testread32.py`. You don't have to understand how any of this testing
framework operates, although you will after Act I Scene II!

**FIXME:** The framework of tests is incomplete for all steps in this
weekly assignment, even though the testing code itself (I think) is
complete.
