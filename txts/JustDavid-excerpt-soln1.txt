ACTOR: "Father, are you there?"

ACTOR: "Daddy, come! I've done the bacon all myself, and the potatoes and the
coffee, too. Quick, it's all getting cold!"

ACTOR: "David--it's my little son David!"

ACTOR: "Of course it's David! Who else should it be?"

ACTOR: "Come!"

ACTOR: "Things aren't so nice as yours, father,"

ACTOR: "I'm afraid
I'm nothing but a discord in that orchestra to-day! Somehow, some of
the stove was hotter than the rest, and burnt up the bacon in spots;
and all the water got out of the potatoes, too,--though THAT didn't
matter, for I just put more cold in. I forgot and left the milk in the
sun, and it tastes bad now; but I'm sure next time it'll be better--all
of it."

The End.
